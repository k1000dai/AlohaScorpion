# AlohaScorpion
AlohaScorpion is a 7 dof + gripper, dual-arm mobile manipulator with lift. It is designed for research and development in robotics, particularly in manipulation and mobile robotics.
This project is heavily inspired by the 

- Lerobot(https://github.com/k1000dai/lerobot)
- Alohamini(https://github.com/liyiteng/AlohaMini)
- Xlerobot(https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot)
- DualScorpion(https://github.com/momoiorg-repository/dual_scorpion)

## Features
- 7 degrees of freedom per arm for enhanced manipulation capabilities. inspired by dual_scorpion

- Gripper for object handling. use xlerobot tpu gripper. Also, some base parts are compatible with xlerobot.

- Mobile base for navigation and mobility. based on alohamini.

- Lift mechanism for vertical movement. based on Alohamini.

- Data collection and logging capabilities for research purposes. based on the lerobot framework.
